    A simple K-winner take all function for creating layers with sparse output.
    Use the boost strength to compute a boost factor for each unit represented
    in x. These factors are used to increase the impact of each unit to improve
    their chances of being chosen. This encourages participation of more columns
    in the learning process.
    The boosting function is a curve defined as:
    .. math::
        boostFactors = \\exp(-boostStrength \\times (dutyCycles - targetDensity))
    Intuitively this means that units that have been active (i.e. in the top-k)
    at the target activation level have a boost factor of 1, meaning their
    activity is not boosted. Columns whose duty cycle drops too much below that
    of their neighbors are boosted depending on how infrequently they have been
    active. Unit that has been active more than the target activation level
    have a boost factor below 1, meaning their activity is suppressed and
    they are less likely to be in the top-k.
    Note that we do not transmit the boosted values. We only use boosting to
    determine the winning units.
    The target activation density for each unit is k / number of units. The
    boostFactor depends on the duty_cycles via an exponential function::
